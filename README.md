# What factors influence the price of a vehicle?

**Assignment notebook:** https://github.com/vincentwenger/vehicle_price_factors/blob/main/prompt_II.ipynb

## What is the problem?
This project aims to understand what factors of the vehicle will drive the price of the vehicle. The goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.

## What is the data?
This data is a dataset from Kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure the speed of processing.

## What are the findings?

The findings are that :
- we can predict the price of the car based on the attribute "year", "cylinders", "odometer". When analyzing the data we noticed that the average of price are :
- higher in UT, cheaper in ME
- higher for white car, cheaper for green car
- higher for pickup, cheaper for mini-van
- higher for full_size, cheaper for compact
- higher for 4wd drive and cheaper for fwd drive
- the transmission type doesn't seem to impact too much the price
- higher for lien title_status and cheaper for parts only or salvage
- higher for diesel fuel and cheaper for hybrid fuel
- higher in general for more cylinders
- higher when condition is new, cheaper when condition is fair or salvage
- higher for ferrari and cheaper for toyota

## What do I recommend?

- It is better to buy white cars
- We recommend to install a car dealership un Utah as we will be able to make more money selling cars
- It is better to buy more full size pick-ups with 4wd drive, with as many cylinders as possible
- It is recommended to buy new car working with diesel
